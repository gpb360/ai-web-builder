# Setup Notes & Environment Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Setup

### Frontend Environment
- **pnpm** installed and working (v10.13.1)
- **Next.js 15.3.5** with Turbopack working
- **TypeScript & ESLint** configured
- **Shared package** building successfully
- **All dependencies** installed correctly

**Frontend Test Result:** ‚úÖ WORKING
- Next.js dev server starts successfully in 1.06s
- Available at http://localhost:3000
- Turbopack compilation working

### Project Structure
- **Monorepo** with pnpm workspaces configured
- **TypeScript types** shared between packages
- **Environment files** created and configured

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Python Environment Needs Setup

### Current Issue
- Python 3.x is available but missing pip and venv
- Need to install Python development packages

### Required Installation (Run on Host System)
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv python3-dev

# Or if using Python 3.12 specifically
sudo apt install python3.12-venv python3-pip
```

### After Python Setup
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üéØ Development Commands (Working)

```bash
# Start frontend only (WORKING)
pnpm --filter frontend dev

# Type checking (WORKING)
pnpm type-check

# Build shared package (WORKING)
pnpm --filter shared build

# Linting (Ready to test)
pnpm --filter frontend lint
```

## Next Steps

1. **Install Python packages** on host system
2. **Test backend startup** with FastAPI
3. **Start DEV-002: Database Schema Design**
