# Claude AI Assistant Instructions for AI Web Builder Platform

## Project Overview

You are the AI development assistant for building a **revolutionary AI-native marketing platform** that competes with GoHighLevel and Simvoly. This platform uses AI to automatically build complete marketing campaigns, allowing users to describe their needs and receive fully functional campaigns with minimal manual work.

## Core Mission

**Build the world's first AI-native marketing platform that eliminates complexity through intelligent automation.**

- **Primary Goal:** Create a platform where users describe their business and AI builds everything
- **Key Differentiator:** "AI builds it, you just tweak it" approach
- **Target Market:** SMBs frustrated with GoHighLevel's complexity
- **Business Model:** SaaS with 80%+ margins through efficient AI usage

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, React Query
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.11+), PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery
- **AI Integration:** Anthropic Claude (primary), OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-4V (fallback)
- **Infrastructure:** AWS (ECS, RDS, S3, CloudFront), Vercel (frontend)

2. **Monitor costs in real-time** - alert if usage exceeds budget
3. **Implement intelligent caching** - reuse similar components
4. **Rate limiting** - prevent abuse and cost spikes
5. **Progressive model selection** - use cheapest model that can handle task

### Pricing Strategy (Must Maintain 80%+ Margins)
- **Creator Tier:** $49/month (25 campaigns, 86% margin)
- **Business Tier:** $149/month (100 campaigns, 84% margin)  
- **Agency Tier:** $399/month (500 campaigns, 67% margin)

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
1. **TypeScript Everywhere:** Strict typing, no `any` types
2. **Error Handling:** Comprehensive try-catch, user-friendly messages
3. **Performance First:** Optimize for speed, implement caching
4. **Security:** Input validation, SQL injection prevention, secure secrets
5. **Testing:** Unit tests for all utilities, integration tests for APIs

## Git Workflow - MANDATORY PROCESS

### **ðŸš« NEVER WORK DIRECTLY ON MAIN BRANCH**
- **Always create feature branches** for any work
- **Never commit directly to main** - all changes must go through Pull Requests
- **All code must be reviewed** before merging to main

### **Required Git Workflow Steps:**

1. **Create Feature Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name
   # Example: git checkout -b feature/add-user-auth
   # Example: git checkout -b fix/hydration-errors
   # Example: git checkout -b enhancement/improve-performance
   ```

2. **Work on Feature:**
   ```bash
   # Make your changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "descriptive commit message"
   ```

3. **Push to Remote:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/feature-name
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request:**
   ```bash
   # Use GitHub CLI or web interface
   gh pr create --title "Feature: Add user authentication" --body "Description of changes"
   ```

5. **After PR Review & Approval:**
   ```bash
   # Merge through GitHub interface, then clean up
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git branch -d feature/feature-name
   ```

### **Branch Naming Conventions:**
- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes  
- `enhancement/description` - Improvements to existing features
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates

### **Commit Message Format:**
```
type: Brief description of change

- Detailed explanation of what was changed
- Why the change was necessary
- Any breaking changes or important notes

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

### **PR Requirements:**
- **Clear title and description** of what was changed
- **Link to related issues** if applicable
- **Test results** - confirm all tests pass
- **Screenshots** for UI changes
- **Breaking changes** clearly documented

### **Example Workflow:**
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/add-pricing-page

# Work on feature
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add pricing page with 3-tier structure"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/add-pricing-page
gh pr create --title "Feature: Add pricing page" --body "Adds 3-tier pricing structure with monthly/annual options"

# After approval and merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/add-pricing-page
```

### **ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL RULES:**
1. **NO DIRECT COMMITS TO MAIN** - Automatic rejection
2. **ALL FEATURES REQUIRE PR REVIEW** - No exceptions
3. **PUSH EARLY AND OFTEN** - Don't wait until feature is complete
4. **KEEP BRANCHES SMALL** - 1 feature per branch maximum
5. **DELETE BRANCHES AFTER MERGE** - Keep repository clean

### AI Integration Standards
